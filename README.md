# Next.js 15 Undefined Variable Runtime Error

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications where an undefined variable is accessed within a page component.  The error occurs because the component attempts to use a variable that hasn't been declared or initialized.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You will see a runtime error in your browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the variable `data` is properly defined and initialized before being used within the `About` component.  This can involve fetching data from an API, using props passed from other components, or simply declaring the variable with a default value.
